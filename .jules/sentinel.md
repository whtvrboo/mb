## 2024-05-23 - [Insecure Password Storage Placeholder]
**Vulnerability:** Found `mitlist/modules/documents/service.py` using Base64 encoding for "encrypting" shared credential passwords, with a comment "replace with Fernet/vault in production".
**Learning:** Placeholder security code is a major risk. Developers might assume encryption is in place because of the function names `_encrypt_password`.
**Prevention:** Never commit insecure placeholder crypto. If a dependency is missing, fail loud or use a dummy implementation that raises NotImplementedError, rather than a vulnerable one. Always verify "encryption" functions actually encrypt.
