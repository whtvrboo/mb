## 2024-05-23 - Polymorphic Relationship Indexing
**Learning:** The `Comment` model uses a polymorphic relationship (`parent_type`, `parent_id`) but only had an index on `parent_id`. This causes inefficient index scans when `parent_id` values collide across different types (common with autoincrement integer IDs).
**Action:** Always check polymorphic associations for composite indexes `(type, id)` or `(type, id, sort_col)`.

## 2024-05-23 - Notification Sorting Optimization
**Learning:** `list_notifications` queries by `user_id` and sorts by `created_at DESC`. The single index on `user_id` forces the database to sort results in memory after fetching.
**Action:** Add composite indexes `(filter_col, sort_col)` for frequently accessed sorted lists like feeds and activity logs.

## 2024-05-24 - Redundant Indexing with Composite Indexes
**Learning:** When adding a composite index `(col_a, col_b)` to optimize `WHERE col_a = ? ORDER BY col_b`, the existing index on `col_a` becomes redundant as the composite index can serve queries on `col_a` alone.
**Action:** Remove `index=True` from the leading column of a new composite index to save storage and write overhead.

## 2026-02-15 - Alembic Migration Conflict
**Learning:** The repository contained migration files with conflicting `down_revision` (multiple heads), causing Alembic to fail or require manual intervention. Specifically, `016_optimize_finance_index.py` and `016_optimize_chores_indexes.py` both depended on `015`.
**Action:** Always check `alembic/versions/` for existing heads before creating a new migration. If conflicts exist, linearize them by updating `down_revision` of the newer/conflicting migration before adding a new one.
