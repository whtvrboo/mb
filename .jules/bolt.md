## 2024-05-23 - Polymorphic Relationship Indexing
**Learning:** The `Comment` model uses a polymorphic relationship (`parent_type`, `parent_id`) but only had an index on `parent_id`. This causes inefficient index scans when `parent_id` values collide across different types (common with autoincrement integer IDs).
**Action:** Always check polymorphic associations for composite indexes `(type, id)` or `(type, id, sort_col)`.

## 2024-05-23 - Notification Sorting Optimization
**Learning:** `list_notifications` queries by `user_id` and sorts by `created_at DESC`. The single index on `user_id` forces the database to sort results in memory after fetching.
**Action:** Add composite indexes `(filter_col, sort_col)` for frequently accessed sorted lists like feeds and activity logs.

## 2024-05-23 - Redundant Index Cleanup
**Learning:** When adding a composite index (e.g., `(A, B)`) to optimize sorting, the existing single index on column A becomes redundant if A is the leading column of the new index.
**Action:** Remove single-column indexes when they are covered by a new composite index to save write overhead and storage.
